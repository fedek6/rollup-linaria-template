# Rollup Linaria template

> This is the one and only full example on how to use `Linaria` with `Rollup`. I've spent way too much time on this ðŸ˜³

This example shows how to use [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria) to build React packages.

It's kind of hard to find any documentation for this library (which is kind of bummer). So, the best thing you can do with it is to create example repositoriesâ€¦

## Scripts

* `yarn build` â€” this should build `dist` and `style.css` in a root of this project.
* `npm publish` â€” to publish to git NPM.

## Usage

Installation:

```bash
echo "@fedek6:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com" > .yarnrc
yarn add @fedek6/rollup-linaria-template@1.0.3
```

Import:

```tsx
import { HelloWorld } from "@fedek6/rollup-linaria-template";
import "@fedek6/rollup-linaria-template/styles.css";
```
